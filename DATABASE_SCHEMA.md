## Business Logic

### Click Tracking System
1. **Direct Clicks**: When someone clicks a user's referral link
2. **Bonus Clicks**: 20% of sub-partner clicks are credited as bonus clicks
3. **Earnings**: Each click is worth $0.10

### Referral System
1. Users get a unique partner code upon signup
2. When someone signs up with a partner code, they become a sub-partner
3. The referrer gets 500 bonus clicks immediately
4. The referrer gets 20% of all future direct clicks from sub-partners

### Withdrawal System
1. Users must be active for 30+ days
2. Users must have 100+ total clicks
3. Withdrawals are processed manually by admins
4. Minimum withdrawal amount is based on total clicks Ã— $0.10

## Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS enabled with policies that:
- Allow users to view/edit their own data
- Allow admins to view/edit all data
- Restrict sensitive operations to appropriate users

### Authentication
- Uses Supabase Auth for user management
- Automatic user profile creation via triggers
- JWT-based authentication for API access

## Triggers

### `on_auth_user_created`
Automatically creates a user profile in `public.users` when someone signs up via Supabase Auth.

### `trigger_auto_generate_partner_code`
Automatically generates a unique partner code for new users.

### `trigger_auto_generate_short_code`
Automatically generates a unique short code for new URL shortening requests.
